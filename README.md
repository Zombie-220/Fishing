## Introduction
The application is designed for automatic fishing in Roblox Arcane Odyssey v1.15.13 and later.  
Relevance may disappear with the update of fishing mechanics.  
I am writing this project primarily for myself, so support will not be regular.

## What does this application do
~~Helps to spend the saved time on other useless activities~~  
The app does the fishing for you (more details in the "How to start using" section).  

## Install and launch
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Zombie-220/Fishing.git
cd Fishing/dist
main.exe
```

## How to start using
- Stand near the water (preferably where the character will not move)
- Cast a fishing rod
- Press the "START" button
- Make yourself some tea

## Application components
- Main window
- Settings window (saves all changes to a local database)
- History window (records all actions while fishing)

## From author
I will be glad for any feedback ~~keep the negative one for yourself~~ and help in maintaining the functionality of the application.  
The main fishing script was not added to the release version (for personal, not entirely clear reasons).
