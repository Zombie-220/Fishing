## Introduction
The application is designed for automatic fishing in Roblox Arcane Odyssey v1.15.13 and later.  
Relevance may disappear with the update of fishing mechanics.  
I am writing this project primarily for myself, so support will not be regular.  
The app is developed for Windows 10 OS, it may run on other versions of WIndows.

## What does this application do
~~Helps to spend the saved time on other useless activities~~  
The app does the fishing for you.  

## Step-by-step guide how to use it
### Install and launch
___installation using git___
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Zombie-220/Fishing.git
cd Fishing/dist
main.exe
```
___or download zip file from [releases](https://github.com/Zombie-220/Fishing/releases)___ 

### How to start fishing
**Note:** Before you start fishing, it is recommended to check the settings window to see if the keys match (most likely you will need to change them)

- Stand near the water (preferably where the character will not move)
- Bring the camera as close as possible, then press the "O" key once
- Cast a fishing rod
- Press the "START" button
- Make yourself some tea

I will be glad for any feedback ~~keep the negative one for yourself~~ and help in maintaining the functionality of the application.
